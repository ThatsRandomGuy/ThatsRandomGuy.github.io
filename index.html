<h2>Self-assessment</h2>
<p>I believe that the work shown in these projects shows the wide range of skills I have picked up in my computer science journey. My first artifact, thermostat.py, shows how I am able to connect both hardware and software to create projects that I once thought were impossible. The pirate maze artifact shows that I can work with algorithms to solve problems that may be difficult for myself or others. The inventory app shows I can work with databases to store important data and retrieve that data at any point. Each of these skills brings a new and unique aspect of my computer science degree that I had a blast working with.</p>
<p>Through this work, I have realized what it is that I love doing and that is programming. I look forward to opening up my IDE every day and cannot wait to do it as a job in the future. Some skills I was able to practice outside of these artifacts includes things like collaborating with others, communicating with stakeholders, and working to keep my work clean and safe. While these projects do not directly show many of these skills, projects I have done outside of these have. I spend a lot of my spare time working with servers and scripts to automate things around my house. I also learned how to communicate with those that have something at stake with these projects. It is very important to be able to communicate in the computer science field, and I feel like I have been able to get a lot of practice with that throughout my college career.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, each artifact in this portfolio was chosen with a specific goal in mind. To me, there are four major categories of computer science: data structures and algorithms, software engineering, databases, and security. While security was not directly the focus of these projects, it was always kept in mind with things like the way I formatted the code to make it easier for others to work with or how I made sure I did not leave any loose ends that could cause security risks in the future. Overall, I am very proud of these projects and cannot wait to explore more of these fields in the future.</p>
<p>The artifacts in the next few pages do a great job of showing what I am capable of. I hope you enjoy using them as much as I did creating them!</p>
