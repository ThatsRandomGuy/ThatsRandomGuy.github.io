<h1>Thermostat.py</h1>
<h2>Narritive</h2>
<h3>1. Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created? </h3>
<p>This artifact is called Thermostat.py. It was created in April of 2025. The goal of this artifact is to create a model thermostat just like the one in your home. It indicates heating with a red light and cooling with a blue light. </p>
<h3>2. Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?</h3>
<p>I chose this item because it fit perfectly in the software design/engineering category. It demonstrates the ability to combine software development and hardware. It uses a Raspberry Pi and breadboard to create a model thermostat. This artifact was improved by adding a small fan to blow on the temperature sensor to simulate cooling in a room. Now that the temperature sensor can be affected by the system itself, it better represents how an actual thermostat works. The only thing missing would be a way to heat up the sensor to simulate heating. </p>
<h3>3. Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans? </h3>
<p>I do believe that I met the course outcomes for this enhancement. I was able to successfully create an enhancement that shows a noticeable improvement on the overall project’s goals. I do not have any updates to my coverage plan. </p>
<h3>4. Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face? </h3>
<p>I have not worked with Raspberry Pi’s a whole lot so anytime I use one it is a learning experience. Thankfully, the last course I took on Raspberry Pi’s taught me a lot about where to look for information on how to use specific hardware components. Using the fan was extremely intuitive and made a lot of sense. The only challenge I faced on this enhancement was getting the wires mixed up. The thermostat itself has many components that need to be perfectly placed for the system to work. One wire in the wrong place can cause quite a headache. After double checking a couple times, I was able to get the system to work and am quite proud of the work I have done here. </p>
