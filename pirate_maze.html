<h1>Pirate Maze</h1>
<h2>Narritive</h2>
<h3>1. Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created? </h3>
<p>This artifact was created to solve simple puzzles known as the Pirate Game. The Pirate Game consists of a maze with a piece of treasure at the end. Your goal as the player is to reach the end with as little moves as possible. An algorithm was then taught to complete this game. This algorithm only supports 8x8 grid puzzles, however. </p>
<h3>2. Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in algorithms and data structure? How was the artifact improved? </h3>
<p>The goal of using this artifact was to demonstrate the ability to improve upon an already existing and working algorithm. I was able to change the algorithm to support a 12x12 grid. This shows my ability to adapt previously created algorithms.  </p>
<h3>3. Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome coverage plans? </h3>
<p>I did meet the planned outcomes I wished to achieve. I wanted to be able to improve an algorithm and was able to do so. I will not change anything about the outcome coverage at this time. </p>
<h3>4. Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face? </h3>
<p>To enhance this artifact, I needed to first identify what the algorithm was doing as it has been a little while since I last touched the algorithm. Once I familiarized myself, I was able to identify the different sections of code that deal with the puzzle size and solving algorithm. From here I made a new puzzle that was 12x12 grid size and gave it to the algorithm to solve. I did not face any mentionable challenges thankfully. </p>
