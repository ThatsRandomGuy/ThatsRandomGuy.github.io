<h1>Inventory Application</h1>
<h2>Narritive</h2>
<h3>1. Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created? </h3>
<p>This artifact was created about four months ago for a mobile development class. The project's goal was to create an app that could take input from the user to represent their belongings. This could be the inventory of their store, house, or pantry. It had the bare minimum that an inventory app requires.  </p>
<h3>2. Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?</h3>
<p>This artifact is perfect for my portfolio because it shows my work with databases and being able to enter and retrieve data from them. It allows the user to enter items and visually identify what items are available and which are out of stock.  
To improve upon this design, I wanted to add a search feature to find specific items in the already created list. Before this update, the only way to find your items was to manually look through the list and find it. Now, you can use the search bar at the top of the screen to find exactly what you are looking for.  </p>
<h3>3. Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans? </h3>
<p>My goal for this enhancement was to show that I can improve previously created projects to make them better than before. I would say that this improvement makes this project more usable from a user's standpoint. Before, having to scroll through all the items you entered was tedious and annoying. It is now as simple as typing in the item you are searching for. I have not had any changes to my outcome plan as of now. </p>
<h3>4. Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face? </h3>
<p>To enhance this artifact, I had to reinstall all the android studio applications that I had before when I first created this project. This was not a challenging task, but it did bring back a lot of memories. Creating the search bar itself was as simple as dragging an input box into the UI. Making the search bar work was where it got a little tricky. Sorting items by characters entered is something I never realized could be so difficult. In the end, I managed to figure it out and it was well worth the effort. The app is much better than it was before although it could use a little more UI work. </p>
